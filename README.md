Final assignment of the class Algorithm and programming - UFRGS

<h1> Game History</h1>
  <p>When casting a spell, this mage uttered the words incorrectly (and
maybe forgot a semicolon somewhere) and with that,
unleashed a series of magical creatures from another dimension that are
causing chaos in our dimension.</p>
  <p>Some of these creatures are pure magical energy, which the mage needs
recover to go back in time and undo the mess he created. However, other creatures are aggressive magic monsters that can destroy the mage.</p>

<h1> Purpose of Game</h1>
  <p>The objective of the game is to get all the magical creatures in each level, without being caught by the monsters that are now free.
You will have 3 lives to get past these obstacles. </p>

<h1> Game Dependencies</h1>
  <p>I just used the Railyb library, the rest is standard c language.</p>

<h1> Credits </h1>
<p> Work entirely done by me </p>

<h1> Possible Upgrades </h1>
<p>The game is finished for the chair work, but it can still be improved.</p>
<p>The possible features that will enter are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>New phases</li>
  <li>Intelligent movement of creatures</li>
  <li>Cheats for extra fun.</li>
  <li>Maybe textures.</li>
</ul>
